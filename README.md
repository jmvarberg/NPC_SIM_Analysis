The source code used to analyze NPC number and density has been made available as a notebook which can be found [here](https://jmvarberg.github.io/NPC_SIM_Analysis/).

All of the raw data used for analysis, as well as the ImageJ/FIJI macros used to extract NPC positions upstream of the
analysis in R can be found at the [Stowers Institute Original Data Repository](http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1640).
